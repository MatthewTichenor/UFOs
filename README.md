# UFOs

In this project the viewer is going to see a fully devolped html website that was created and filled with data on UFO sightings. We used a jason file and css to fully created the data enivoroment. The use of javascripted was the main enivoroment that we used to apply the coding. For Loops and java function were also used to devoleped the data seen in the html website. To go more in deep I would suggest that a plotpy or a graph to show the actual number of sighting per region of the world. We could go even deeper and filter to showcase more about each siting.
